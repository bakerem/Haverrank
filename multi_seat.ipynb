    "# Python Script for Multi-Seat Elections  (Honor Council Class Reps)\n",
    "#### Based on example script from Github for pyrankvote\n",
    "\n",
    "Necessary imports: pyrankvote and pandas. In order to import these, type pip install pandas and/or pip install pyrankvote\n",
    "\n",
    "VERY IMPORTANT:\n",
    "    At the beginning of each semester, the senior election coordinator should train the junior election coordinator on how to use this.\n",
    "    Please make sure that they understand completely so this process can work smoothly in the future. \n",
    "Steps to run this script successfully:\n",
    "1. Export ballot from Engage\n",
    "2. Clean results file (see below)\n",
    "3. Change list in candidate names to be the names of the candidates. Put these names in quotes. Each name should have no spaces\n",
    "4. Change csv file from \"results.csv\" to the correct file name\n",
    "4. Change the number of seats line to be the correct number\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "How to clean results file\n",
    "1. Delete unnecessary rows so that the only rows are 1 header and one column for each ranking choice.\n",
    "2. The exact header column names do not matter, but something like \"Rank 1\", \"Rank 2\", etc. is sensible.\n",
    "3. Find and Replace all of the candidate names and change them to a one word code like their first name or last name. This is the name you will input in the list of candidate_names in line 7 in this file.\n",
    "4. For Excel: Highlight columns with data and go to \"Find and Select\" -> \"Go to Special\" -> \"Blanks\". Then, once blank rows are highlighted go to delete sheet rows. This will delete all blank rows that would other be annoying to deal with. There is no easy way to do this in Google sheets, so excel is really better.\n",
    "4. Once you do this, you should have a spreadsheet that has one header column and rows with the ranks that different voters gave. Each cell should have one word in it and there should be no blank rows.\n",
    "5. Save the file as a csv file and paste the file path in line 8. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For questions, contact Ethan Baker '24 bakerethan47@gmail.com\n",
    "    If you make changes, replace your name here!!\n"
