# Haverrank
A Repository storing code for ranked choice elections for Haverford College student government positions

The multi_seat file should be used for Honor Council Class representative elections, and the single_seat file should be used for all other elections. 

It is easiest to run these files in the Jupyterhub if you have access. Otherwise, Google Colab is probably the next easiest option.
